- Use Kotlin's null safety features (safe calls ?, non-null assertions !!, elvis operators ?:) to prevent null pointer issues.
- Apply require() and check() functions for parameter validation.
- Add runtime checks for critical operations and validate data integrity at boundaries.
- Use assert() for development-time checks (disabled in production) to catch early bugs.
