- Do not hardcode text in the app; use string resources for all UI text.
- Define strings in res/values/strings.xml using descriptive, hierarchical naming conventions.
- Group related strings together for easier maintenance and localization support.
- Leverage AI assistance to suggest reusing existing resources when duplicate or similar text is detected.
- Identify potential duplicates and recommend consolidating resources to maintain consistency.
