description: Implementation guideline for in-app feedback feature
alwaysApply: true
---

- Render the feedback control in `MainActivity` or base layout so it’s injected into every screen.  
- When triggered, launch a `Compose` overlay (e.g., `ModalBottomSheet`) rather than a full new `Activity`.  
- Auto-capture & package context metadata:
  - Which screen, e.g. `screenRoute` or `screenId` from the NavController  
  - Last user action(s) or UI event log  
  - Equivalent of `appVersion`, `buildNumber`, plus a UTC timestamp  
- For attachments:
  - Use Android’s media picker for screenshots  
  - Compress images client-side to ≤ 500 KB  
- Submit feedback over HTTPS:
  - Retry up to 3× with exponential backoff on network errors  
- Expose retry/cancel in the UI if submission fails; log failures.  
- Ensure the UI remains responsive: show in-flight spinner on the “Send” button and disable it until completion.
