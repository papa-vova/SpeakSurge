description: UI/UX guideline for in-app feedback access
alwaysApply: true

- Provide a persistent, discoverable “Send Feedback” affordance on **every** screen (e.g. toolbar icon, bottom-sheet gesture, or floating button).  
- Label it clearly (“Feedback”, “Report Issue”) and use a familiar icon (e.g. 📨, 💬).  
- Tapping it should open a lightweight overlay/modal—don’t navigate away from the current context.  
- In that overlay, allow:
  - Free-form text input for comments  
  - Quick-selection tags (e.g. “Bug”, “Suggestion”, “Praise”)  
  - Optional attachment controls (screenshot picker, camera snapshot)  
- Always display a brief hint about what context will be auto-included (screen name, recent action).  
- Include a prominent “Send” button and a “Cancel” link to dismiss without losing typed text.  
- After sending, show a non-blocking confirmation toast/snackbar (“Thanks! We received your feedback.”).
